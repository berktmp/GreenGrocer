The Grocery Shopping Calculator program allows users to input the weights of various grocery items, such as apples, pears, tomatoes, bananas, and eggplants, and calculates the total amount to be paid.

The program prompts the user to enter the weight of each item in kilograms and calculates the total amount by multiplying the weight of each item with its corresponding price per kilogram. Finally, it displays the total amount to be paid in Turkish Lira (TL).
